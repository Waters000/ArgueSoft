# ArgueSoft

ArgueSoft is an app on the IOS app store that helps an argument from turning into a fight.

The app monitors the volume level of a conversation and when the sound hits -5db, the app will play a random, "funny" sound clip to let the parties know the argument may be getting too heated.

It also features a list of advice to end a argument faster.
